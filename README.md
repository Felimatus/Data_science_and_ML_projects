# Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio

## Overview

This repository contains selected data science and machine learning projects developed for learning, practice, and professional portfolio purposes.

The projects demonstrate my ability to:

- Clean and analyze real-world datasets
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Engineer meaningful features
- Build, tune, and evaluate machine learning models
- Communicate results clearly through code and documentation

These projects are intended to showcase practical skills to recruiters and hiring managers.
